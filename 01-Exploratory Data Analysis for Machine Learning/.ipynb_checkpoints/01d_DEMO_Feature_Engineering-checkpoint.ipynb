    "While we haven't yet turned to prediction, these feature engineering exercises set the stage. Generally, feature engineering often follows a sort of [_Pareto principle_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), where a large bulk of the predictive gains can be reached through adding a set of intuitive, strong features like polynomial transforms and interactions. Directly incorporating additional information like categorical variables can also be very helpful. Beyond this point, additional feature engineering can provide significant, but potentially diminishing returns. Whether it's worth it depends on the use case for the model. "
